* Project Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website created to showcase my academic background, technical skills, and web development projects.
It represents my ability to design, structure, and implement a complete front-end website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — without relying on external frameworks.
The website features an elegant, modern, and fully responsive design with both light and dark themes, ensuring accessibility and aesthetic appeal across devices.
Each page demonstrates distinct aspects of professional web design, including layout management, color theory, animation, and user interaction.
